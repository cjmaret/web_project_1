New Issues 3/2

1. A horizontal scrolling on desktop resolutions: 1612px and smaller.

2. Footer markup and layout is incorrect: it's 100px higher than it should be. Please, check the brief and keep in mind that paddings increase the element dimensions by default, 
to make both paddings and content fit into the assigned height, it's necessary to use box-sizing: border-box. Note that the last two columns should have the same layout (spacing, colors),
 with the only difference that social links have icons inside them.
